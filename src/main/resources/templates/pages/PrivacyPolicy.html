        <p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how The Sun Publishing Limited (“The Sun Publishing Limited”,
            “we”, “us” or “our”) collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information
            (“Personal Information”) you (“User”, “you” or “your”) may provide on the www.sunnewsonline.com
            website and any of its products or services (collectively, “Website” or “Services”). It also describes
            the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and
            update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own
            or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
        </p>
        <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>

            We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish

            include your email address, name, phone number, address, credit card information,  or

        <h3>Collection of non-personal information</h3>
        <p>
            When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This
            data may include information such as your device’s IP address, browser type and version, operating

            transactions; send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc;  run and operate

            information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of
            the system.

        <h3>Billing and payments</h3>
        <p>We use third-party payment processors to assist us in processing your payment information securely.
